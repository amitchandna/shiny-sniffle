This is a deep learning project that aims to make use of TensorFlow and demonstrate a personal skill set.

As this is meant to be a simple application of TensorFlow to help demonstrate my own personal abilities to use this technology, this project will look at applying TensorFlow to the MNIST data set to increase the accuracy with which one can classify the images. We will start with a simple model that makes use of basic classification of the MNIST data set then create a model that looks at the use of TensorFlow to classify the data set in a much more efficienct manner.
